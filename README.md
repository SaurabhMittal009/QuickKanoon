## An android app to help everyone understand the Indian laws easily

WORK IN PROGRESS !

Most of the citizens of India are not well-aware of their rights and laws.

This makes them rely solely on lawyers in judicial matters , and often duped/cheated in the name of law.

This app aims to make citizens of India self-sufficient in this matter and educate them about the laws , and also act as a handy quick-reference guide to the laws applicable in common situations .

This project is completely open-source , and the app will be released as a free app in the Google Play store. 

Currently working on :
* Tag-based search engine to search from a large collection of laws 
* Easy to find laws applicable in most common day-to-day scenarios
* Clear explanation of the laws in simple english 
* Bookmark laws for easy access
* Releasing on google play once development is over

Future plans :
* NLP-based searching for better experience
* Regional translations 
* Expanding the collection of laws
* Try to go global if project gains enough traction
* Make a similar web app so every device can use the service.
